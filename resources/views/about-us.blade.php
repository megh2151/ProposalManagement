        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We created Letter to AsoRock in response to the president's call for mindset change and patriotism during his campaign. He urged us to ask what we can do for our country. The citizens have valuable ideas that can improve Nigeria, but they may not have access to government agencies that can implement them. That's why we built a portal that allows citizens to submit their ideas or proposals in a transparent and efficient way, bypassing the bureaucratic process. This way, we can connect with the government and bring positive change to our country. Please share this on social media and with your friends.</p>
